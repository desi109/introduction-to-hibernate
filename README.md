## Exercises: Introduction to Hibernate

Create soft_uni database.<br>
Work with database soft_uni. Commands which can be used:
- `Check for employee` /then write employee name/.
- `Add address to employee` /first write town name, write new address then write employee's name whose address you want to be updated/.
- `Find` (this command finds 10 addresses, ordered by the number of employees).
- `Find projects`(this command finds the last 10 started projects, prints their name, description, start and end date and sort them by name lexicographically).



### 3. Contains Employee<br>
Use the soft_uni database. Write a program that checks if a given employee name is contained in the database. Write command `check for employee` to find if the name exists in database soft_uni.
  
### 6. Adding a New Address and Updating Employee<br>
Create a new address. Set that address to an employee with a last name, given as an input. Write command `add address to employee` to create  a new address in database soft_uni.

### 7. Addresses with Employee Count<br>
Find all addresses, ordered by the number of employees who live there (descending), then by town id (ascending).Take only the first 10 addresses and print their address text, town name and employee count. Write command `find`.
 
 ### 9. Find Latest 10 Projects<br>
 Write a program that prints the last 10 started projects. Print their name, description, start and end date and sort them by name lexicographically. For the output, check the format from the example. Write command `find projects`.
